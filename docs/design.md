# CognIQ UX/UI Design Principles (Draft)

## Goals
- Keep the test interface clear, calm, and distraction-free.
- Make interactions accessible across devices and input methods.
- Support fair testing conditions with consistent timing and presentation.

## Principles
1. **Clarity first**: one primary task per screen.
2. **Accessibility baseline**: keyboard support, contrast, readable typography.
3. **Consistency**: fixed layout for item prompt/options/timer.
4. **Low cognitive overhead**: minimal non-essential text during timed items.
5. **Honest feedback**: show prototype status for early scoring.

## MVP Flow
- Welcome and consent
- Brief instructions + practice item
- Timed item sequence
- Result summary with transparent caveats
