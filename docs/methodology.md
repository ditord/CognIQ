# CognIQ Methodology (Draft)

## Purpose
This document defines the scientific and practical design principles for CognIQ so item writing, scoring, and validation remain consistent.

## Constructs Covered
The MVP focuses on three constructs described in the project overview:

1. **Fluid Reasoning**
   - Abstract pattern completion
   - Rule induction
2. **Working Memory**
   - Short-term retention and manipulation
3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Sequence continuation
   - Matrix-style non-verbal logic

## MVP Test Blueprint (Initial)
| Domain | Target Item Count | Difficulty Bands | Time Guidance |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Fluid Reasoning | 8 | easy/medium/hard | 45–90s per item |
| Working Memory | 6 | easy/medium/hard | 30–75s per item |
| Pattern Recognition | 8 | easy/medium/hard | 45–90s per item |

## Fairness & Bias Controls
- Favor non-verbal prompts and visual logic.
- Avoid culturally specific symbols, language, and prior-knowledge assumptions.
- Use structured item review checklist before publishing an item.
- Track pilot performance by subgroup where ethically and legally appropriate.

## Scoring Philosophy (MVP)
- Start with deterministic raw scoring (correct/incorrect + optional timing metadata).
- Convert raw score to provisional scaled score for UX readability.
- Mark all early scores as **prototype** until calibration data exists.

## Validation Plan (Post-MVP)
- Run pilot with adequate sample size.
- Compute item difficulty and discrimination indices.
- Remove or revise low-quality items.
- Recalibrate score mapping and publish methodology updates.
